# dockerized-web-apps-from-GitHub-repos
Ibrahim's collected dataset of web apps specifically from the GitHub repositories

# note to self for later
- make READme files for all the folders inside /github_repo_config_files
- it was overkill for now but later on I should/can remove the cloned_githubs folder as it's not necessary for future development
- the test_images.sh file is a great representation/method of how we can automate this process in the future for this AI model (still can be tweaked)
- NOTE TO SRIJAN: IM still working on this, so let's not merge anything together until after Monday's meeting (7/14)
