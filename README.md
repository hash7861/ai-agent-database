# Dockerized-Web-Apps-Ibrahim
Ibrahim's collected dataset of web apps specifically from the GitHub repositories
Please attach the Google Doc (as a PDF) to give more clarity as to what is going on

# Important Notes
- make READme files for ALL the folders inside /github_repo_config_files (see Xinyou's PDF)
- it was overkill for now but later on I should/can remove the cloned_githubs folder as it's not necessary for future development (got rid of it)
- sift through all the folders inside  /github_repo_config_files to check for incorrect folders
- manage the  /github_repo_config_files/troublesome_config_files very carefully
- the test_images.sh file is a great representation/method of how we can automate this process in the future for this web app AI model (still can be tweaked)
- NOTE TO SRIJAN: IM still working on this, so let's not merge anything together until after Monday's meeting (7/14)
